# covctl
This repo contains projects related to the Covalent API, and specifically to pulling Klaytn data from the Covalent API  

As of now this repo contains 2 projects:

- A CLI tool to interact with the Covalent APIs `covctl`: https://github.com/mark-ruddy/covctl/tree/main/covctl
- `covctl` uses this library called `covalent_class_a` to interact with the APIs: https://github.com/mark-ruddy/covctl/tree/main/covalent_class_a

Exposing the majority of the Covalent Class A API endpoints with the library `covalent_class_a` allows other Rust developers to write their Covalent-based Dapps faster and more reliably
